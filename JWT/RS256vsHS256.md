## Why choose rs256 over hs256 in jwt.

Great question 👍 Let’s break it down clearly:

---

## 🔑 **HS256 vs RS256 in JWT**

### **HS256 (HMAC + SHA-256)**

* Uses a **shared secret key** (same key for signing & verifying).
* Faster because it’s symmetric.
* **Risk**: If the secret key is leaked or shared with multiple services, **anyone can both generate and validate tokens** → higher security risk.

---

### **RS256 (RSA + SHA-256)**

* Uses **asymmetric encryption** (private key for signing, public key for verifying).
* Private key stays only with the **auth server**.
* Public key can be **safely shared** with other services/microservices for verification.
* Even if public key leaks, tokens **cannot be forged** (because signing still needs the private key).
* More secure for **distributed systems** or **third-party integrations**.
* Slightly slower than HS256 due to RSA operations.

## ✅ **Why choose RS256 over HS256?**

1. **Better Security in Distributed Systems**

   * In microservices/large apps, many services need to **verify** JWTs.
   * With RS256, you only share the **public key** (safe), not the signing key.

2. **Key Separation**

   * Signing (private key) is done only by the **auth server**.
   * Verification (public key) can be done by **any number of services** without risk.

3. **Safer Against Key Leaks**

   * If the public key leaks → no issue.
   * If HS256 secret leaks → attackers can **both forge & verify** tokens.

---

### 🔎 In short:

* **HS256** → good for simple, single-server setups (fast, but risky if secret leaks).
* **RS256** → better for **scalable & secure architectures**, especially with microservices, 3rd-party APIs, or cloud deployments.

👉 Would you like me to also give you a **real-world example scenario** (like how RS256 is used in OAuth2/JWT with Google or Auth0)? That makes it even clearer in interviews.
