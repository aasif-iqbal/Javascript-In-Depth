In Node.js, **worker threads** and **child processes** serve different purposes for handling parallel execution. Here's a brief guide on when to use each:

### **When to Use Worker Threads**
- **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Use for computationally heavy tasks within JavaScript, like data encryption, image processing, complex calculations (e.g., Fibonacci, sorting large datasets), or ML model inference.
- **Shared Memory**: When you need to share memory between threads (using `SharedArrayBuffer`) for faster data exchange, but with careful synchronization.
- **Lightweight Execution**: Ideal when you want to run JavaScript code in parallel within the same Node.js process, leveraging multi-core CPUs without the overhead of separate processes.
- **Example**: Encrypting user data, resizing images in a web app, or processing large JSON datasets.
- **Why**: Lower memory overhead, faster setup, and direct communication via message passing or shared memory.

### **When to Use Child Processes**
- **External Programs or Scripts**: Use for running non-JavaScript tasks, such as executing shell commands, Python scripts, or external tools like ImageMagick or FFmpeg.
- **I/O-Heavy or Isolated Tasks**: Suitable for tasks that donâ€™t need shared memory, like running system commands (`ls`, `git`), processing large files, or tasks requiring complete isolation.
- **High Isolation Needs**: When you need a separate process to prevent crashes or memory leaks from affecting the main app (e.g., running untrusted code).
- **Example**: Running a Python script for data analysis, executing shell commands, or processing videos with FFmpeg.
- **Why**: Complete isolation, ability to run non-JS programs, and robust handling of I/O via streams or IPC.

### **Quick Comparison**
| **Criteria**           | **Worker Threads**                  | **Child Processes**                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Tasks**              | CPU-bound, JS-based                | I/O-bound, external programs       |
| **Memory**             | Shared (same process)              | Separate (new process)             |
| **Overhead**           | Lower (threads)                    | Higher (processes)                 |
| **Communication**      | Message passing, SharedArrayBuffer | IPC, streams                       |
| **Use Case**           | Parallel JS tasks (e.g., crypto)   | External tools (e.g., shell, Python) |

### **Rule of Thumb**
- Use **worker threads** for parallelizing JavaScript-heavy, CPU-intensive tasks within the same Node.js process.
- Use **child processes** for running external commands, scripts, or when you need complete isolation between tasks.
