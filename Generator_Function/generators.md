In JavaScript, a **generator** is a special type of function that can pause its execution and later resume from where it left off. This is achieved using the `function*` syntax and the `yield` keyword. Generators are useful for handling asynchronous operations, lazy evaluation, or managing complex data flows.

### Key Features of Generators:
1. **Defined with `function*`:**
   - A generator function is declared using the `function*` syntax.
   
2. **Execution with `.next()`:**
   - When a generator function is called, it does not execute immediately. Instead, it returns a **generator object** that adheres to the **iterator protocol**.
   - You can control the execution by calling the `.next()` method on the generator object.

3. **`yield` Keyword:**
   - A generator function can yield values at any point during its execution.
   - The `yield` keyword pauses the function and allows it to return a value to the caller.

4. **State Preservation:**
   - When a generator is paused (via `yield`), it preserves its execution state. It can resume from where it was paused, along with its local variables.

### Example of a Generator:

```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1; // Pause and return 1
  yield 2; // Pause and return 2
  yield 3; // Pause and return 3
}

const gen = numberGenerator();

console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

### Key Points:
1. **`value` and `done`:**
   - Each `.next()` call returns an object with two properties:
     - `value`: The value yielded by the generator.
     - `done`: A boolean indicating whether the generator has completed execution.

2. **Infinite Generators:**
   - You can create infinite generators by omitting a termination condition.
   
   ```javascript
   function* infiniteNumbers() {
     let num = 1;
     while (true) {
       yield num++;
     }
   }

   const infiniteGen = infiniteNumbers();
   console.log(infiniteGen.next().value); // 1
   console.log(infiniteGen.next().value); // 2
   ```

3. **Generators and Iterables:**
   - Generators are inherently iterable, making them useful in loops like `for...of`:
   
   ```javascript
   function* fruits() {
     yield 'Apple';
     yield 'Banana';
     yield 'Cherry';
   }

   for (const fruit of fruits()) {
     console.log(fruit);
   }
   ```

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Lazy Evaluation:**
   - Generate values only when needed, avoiding the cost of precomputing large datasets.

2. **Handling Asynchronous Operations:**
   - Generators combined with Promises allow for cleaner asynchronous workflows (e.g., managing asynchronous tasks without nesting).

3. **State Machines:**
   - Useful in scenarios where you need to keep track of multiple states.

4. **Implementing Iterators:**
   - Simplify the creation of custom iterators.
