# 205. Isomorphic Strings - [Easy]
```txt
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- t.length == s.length
- s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
```
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isIsomorphic = function(s, t) {
     // Mappings for s -> t and t -> s
    const mappingSToT = new Map();
    const mappingTToS = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const charS = s[i];
        const charT = t[i];

        // Check if the mapping is consistent for s -> t
        if (mappingSToT.has(charS)) {
            if (mappingSToT.get(charS) !== charT) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            mappingSToT.set(charS, charT);
        }

        // Check if the mapping is consistent for t -> s
        if (mappingTToS.has(charT)) {
            if (mappingTToS.get(charT) !== charS) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            mappingTToS.set(charT, charS);
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

# 151. Reverse Words in a String - [***Medium***]
```
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.
 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
```
Hereâ€™s another approach to reverse the words in a string without explicitly using `split()` or `reverse()`.

### Implementation:
```javascript
function reverseWords(s) {
    let result = "";
    let word = "";
    
    // Step 1: Traverse the string in reverse
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const char = s[i];
        
        // Step 2: Build words character by character
        if (char !== ' ') {
            word = char + word;
        } else if (word) { // If a word is completed and there's a space
            if (result) result += " ";
            result += word;
            word = ""; // Reset for the next word
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Add the last word if it exists
    if (word) {
        if (result) result += " ";
        result += word;
    }

    return result;
}

// Test cases
console.log(reverseWords("the sky is blue"));       // Output: "blue is sky the"
console.log(reverseWords("  hello world  "));       // Output: "world hello"
console.log(reverseWords("a good   example"));      // Output: "example good a"
console.log(reverseWords("   a"));                  // Output: "a"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Traverse Backward**:
   - Start from the end of the string to find words in reverse order.
2. **Build Words**:
   - Use a temporary variable (`word`) to construct words character by character.
3. **Add Words to Result**:
   - When a word ends (indicated by a space), append it to the result.
   - Use a check to ensure no leading or trailing spaces are added.
4. **Final Word**:
   - Add the last word after the loop completes if it exists.

### Advantages:
- Avoids using built-in methods like `split()` and `reverse()` for educational purposes.
- Handles spaces naturally due to the character-by-character traversal.

**a.** Should we explore more edge cases like strings with only spaces or single-character words?  
**b.** Would you like to compare this approach to a more efficient `regex`-based solution?

58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.
```

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
  let str = s.trim();
     
     let arr = str.split(' ');
     let imap = new Map();
     
     for(let i=0; i< arr.length; i++){
            imap.set(arr[i], arr[i].length)    
     };
     
     let sortMap = Array.from(imap).at(-1);
     
     return sortMap[1]
};
```
# Length Of Largest Word
```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLargestWord = function(s) {
  let str = s.trim();
     
     let arr = str.split(' ');
     let imap = new Map();
     
     for(let i=0; i< arr.length; i++){
            imap.set(arr[i], arr[i].length)    
     };
     
     let sortMap = Array.from(imap).sort((a, b)=>b[1] - a[1])
     // return largest string in array.
     let output = sortMap[0].slice(1)
     return parseInt(output);  
};
```
