## Types of Problem Solving.  
String problem-solving questions often test a developer's ability to manipulate, analyze, and optimize operations on text data. Below is a categorized list of common types of string problems:

---

### **1. Basic Operations**
- **Character Access**
  - Find the first or last character of a string.
  - Retrieve a substring from a given range of indices.
- **Length and Validation**
  - Determine the length of a string.
  - Check if a string is empty or contains only spaces.
- **Concatenation**
  - Concatenate two or more strings.
- **Case Conversion**
  - Convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.
  - Toggle the case of characters in a string.
- **Trimming**
  - Remove leading and trailing spaces.

---

### **2. Searching and Matching**
- **Substring Search**
  - Check if a string contains a specific substring.
  - Find the index of the first/last occurrence of a substring.
- **Pattern Matching**
  - Check if a string matches a given pattern (e.g., regex).
  - Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
- **Character Frequency**
  - Count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.
  - Find the most/least frequent character.

---

### **3. Reversal and Rotation**
- **Reversal Problems**
  - Reverse the entire string.
  - Reverse individual words in a string while maintaining their order.
- **Rotation Problems**
  - Check if one string is a rotation of another.
  - Rotate a string left or right by `k` positions.

---

### **4. Substrings and Subsequences**
- **Substrings**
  - Generate all substrings of a string.
  - Count the number of substrings that satisfy a condition (e.g., palindromic substrings).
- **Subsequences**
  - Generate all subsequences of a string.
  - Find the longest subsequence common to two strings (LCS).

---

### **5. Palindromes**
- Check if a string is a palindrome.
- Find the longest palindromic substring.
- Count the number of palindromic substrings in a string.
- Make a string a palindrome by adding/removing characters.

---

### **6. Anagrams**
- Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
- Group anagrams from a list of strings.
- Find all anagram substrings of a string.

---

### **7. Compression and Encoding**
- **Compression**
  - Perform basic string compression (e.g., "aaabbc" â†’ "a3b2c1").
  - Decode a compressed string.
- **Encoding**
  - Encode a string using Run Length Encoding (RLE).
  - Convert a string to its ASCII representation and back.

---

### **8. Word-Level Problems**
- Count the number of words in a string.
- Find the longest/shortest word in a sentence.
- Reverse the order of words in a string.
- Check if two sentences are permutations of each other.

---

### **9. Pattern-Based Problems**
- Find the longest prefix which is also a suffix.
- Check if a string follows a specific pattern (e.g., binary string, repetitive characters).
- Remove all adjacent duplicate characters in a string.

---

### **10. Sliding Window and Two-Pointer Techniques**
- Find the longest substring without repeating characters.
- Find the smallest substring containing all characters of another string.
- Count distinct characters in all substrings of a given length.
- Find the length of the longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters.

---

### **11. Dynamic Programming on Strings**
- Longest common subsequence (LCS) of two strings.
- Longest common substring of two strings.
- Edit distance (minimum operations to convert one string to another).
- Split a string into the minimum number of palindromic partitions.

---

### **12. Advanced Problems**
- Check if one string is a scrambled version of another.
- Generate permutations of a string.
- Evaluate a string as a mathematical expression (e.g., "3+5*2").
- Implement a basic text editor with undo/redo functionality.

---

### **13. Miscellaneous**
- Remove vowels/consonants from a string.
- Replace all spaces with a specific character (e.g., `'%20'` in URLs).
- Remove duplicates while maintaining order.
- Find the lexicographically smallest/largest permutation of a string.
- Check if a string is a valid shuffle of two other strings.

---

### **Examples by Difficulty**
#### **Easy**
- Reverse a string.
- Check if two strings are anagrams.
- Count the vowels and consonants in a string.

#### **Medium**
- Longest substring without repeating characters.
- Find all permutations of a string.
- Check if a string can be segmented into dictionary words.

#### **Hard**
- Smallest window containing all characters of another string.
- Regular expression matching.
- Scramble string problem.

### **Tips for Solving String Problems**
1. **Understand the Problem:** Carefully read constraints (e.g., string length, allowed characters).
2. **Choose the Right Tools:** Use built-in string functions (e.g., `split`, `substring`) and libraries when allowed.
3. **Think About Edge Cases:** Consider cases like empty strings, single-character strings, and strings with repetitive patterns.
4. **Optimize for Large Inputs:** Analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.
