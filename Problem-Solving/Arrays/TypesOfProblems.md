## Type of questions on problem solving of array.
When it comes to problem-solving with arrays, the types of questions can vary widely depending on the difficulty level and the focus area. Below are common types of array problems categorized by themes and concepts:

---

### **1. Basic Operations**
- **Accessing Elements**
  - Find the element at a specific index.
  - Retrieve the first/last element of the array.
- **Updating Elements**
  - Replace all occurrences of a given value with another value.
  - Update elements based on conditions (e.g., all negative values become zero).

---

### **2. Searching and Sorting**
- **Search Problems**
  - Find an element in an array (linear search or binary search).
  - Count the occurrences of a specific element.
- **Sorting Problems**
  - Sort the array in ascending/descending order.
  - Sort an array of objects by a specific key (e.g., age in an array of people).
- **Special Sorting**
  - Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s without using a sorting algorithm.
  - Group similar elements together (e.g., even numbers first, then odd).

---

### **3. Subarrays and Subsets**
- Find the sum of all subarrays.
- Find the maximum sum of a subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm).
- Count the number of subarrays with a given sum.
- Generate all subsets of an array (powerset).
- Find subarrays/subsequences that satisfy a specific condition (e.g., product less than a number).

---

### **4. Frequency Counting**
- Find the most/least frequent element.
- Check if two arrays are permutations of each other.
- Find the element that appears more than n/2 times (majority element).

---

### **5. Two-Pointer Technique**
- Find pairs in an array with a specific sum.
- Check if an array is a palindrome.
- Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
- Merge two sorted arrays.

---

### **6. Sliding Window**
- Find the maximum/minimum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
- Count the number of distinct elements in all subarrays of size `k`.
- Longest substring without repeating characters (applied to arrays of characters).

---

### **7. Mathematical and Logical Challenges**
- **Prefix and Suffix Sums**
  - Calculate the prefix sum array or suffix sum array.
  - Check if there is an index where the sum of elements on the left equals the sum on the right (pivot index).
- **Cumulative Operations**
  - Cumulative product of array elements.
  - Difference arrays for range updates.
- **Bitwise Operations**
  - XOR of all elements in an array.
  - Find the single element in an array where all other elements appear twice.

---

### **8. Rotations and Reversals**
- Rotate an array to the left/right by `k` steps.
- Reverse an array in place.
- Check if one array is a rotation of another.

---

### **9. Matrix (2D Array) Problems**
- Find the transpose of a matrix.
- Rotate a matrix by 90 degrees.
- Spiral order traversal of a matrix.
- Find the maximum sum submatrix in a 2D array.

---

### **10. Advanced Problems**
- **Dynamic Programming with Arrays**
  - Longest increasing subsequence.
  - Longest common subsequence (LCS) of two arrays.
  - Maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.
- **Greedy Algorithms**
  - Partition the array into subarrays with equal sum.
  - Minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum elements after `k` operations.

---

### **11. Miscellaneous**
- Rearrange the array in alternating positive and negative order.
- Find the missing number in an array of size `n` containing numbers from `1` to `n`.
- Find the duplicate number in an array.
- Move all zeros to the end while maintaining the relative order of other elements.

### Tips for Solving Array Problems:
1. **Understand the problem:** Clarify requirements and constraints (e.g., sorted array, unique elements).
2. **Choose the right approach:** Depending on the problem, consider brute force, optimized algorithms, or special techniques (e.g., sliding window, two-pointer).
3. **Edge Cases:** Consider edge cases like empty arrays, arrays with one element, or arrays with duplicate values.
4. **Analyze Time Complexity:** Aim for an efficient solution, especially for large input sizes.
