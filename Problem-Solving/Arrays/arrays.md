Here are some **problem-solving questions based on arrays** with their problem statements:

---

### **1. Find the Missing Number**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array of `n-1` integers in the range from `1` to `n`, find the missing number. The array contains distinct numbers, and there is exactly one number missing.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`
- Output: `3`

---

### **2. Rotate an Array**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array and a number `k`, rotate the array `k` times to the right. For example, if `k = 2`, rotate the array by two positions to the right.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `[5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

---

### **3. Find the Intersection of Two Arrays**
**Problem Statement**: Given two arrays, find their intersection (common elements). Assume the arrays contain distinct elements.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, `[2, 2]`
- Output: `[2]`

---

### **4. Find the Subarray with Maximum Sum (Kadane's Algorithm)**
**Problem Statement**: Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example**:
- Input: `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`
- Output: `6` (subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`)

---

### **5. Merge Sorted Arrays**
**Problem Statement**: Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`

---

### **6. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
**Problem Statement**: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length of the array.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 1, 2]`
- Output: `2` (the array becomes `[1, 2]`)

---

### **7. Find the Kth Largest Element**
**Problem Statement**: Given an unsorted array, find the `kth` largest element. For example, the 1st largest is the largest element, the 2nd largest is the second largest element, and so on.

**Example**:
- Input: `[3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `5`

---

### **8. Pair Sum**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers and a target sum, find if there are any two numbers in the array that add up to the target sum.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 9`
- Output: `true` (pairs `(4, 5)` add up to 9)

---

### **9. Find All Pairs with a Given Sum**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers and a target sum, return all pairs of elements that sum up to the target.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `target = 6`
- Output: `[(1, 5), (2, 4)]`

---

### **10. Move Zeroes**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array, move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example**:
- Input: `[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 0]`
- Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0]`

---

### **11. Find the Peak Element**
**Problem Statement**: An element is a peak if it is greater than its neighbors. Given an array of integers, find a peak element. The array may have multiple peak elements, return any of them.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 3, 20, 4, 1, 0]`
- Output: `20`

---

### **12. Reverse an Array**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array, reverse it in place without using any built-in functions.

**Example**:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

---

### **13. Find the Majority Element**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array, find the element that appears more than `n/2` times in the array (if it exists).

**Example**:
- Input: `[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]`
- Output: `4`

---

### **14. Longest Consecutive Sequence**
**Problem Statement**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

**Example**:
- Input: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`
- Output: `4` (The longest consecutive sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`)

---

### **15. Find the Duplicate Number**
**Problem Statement**: Given an array containing `n` integers, where each integer is between `1` and `n-1`, find the duplicate number.

**Example**:
- Input: `[3, 1, 3, 4, 2]`
- Output: `3`

These problems test fundamental array operations and algorithms, including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming, which are important in software development and interviews.
