## Generate Problem on Sort an array of objects by a specific key (e.g., age in an array of people).
Hereâ€™s a solution for the problem of sorting an array of objects by a specific key:

### **Solution**

```javascript
function sortByKey(arr, key, descending = false) {
  return arr.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a[key] < b[key]) {
      return descending ? 1 : -1; // For descending, reverse the comparison
    }
    if (a[key] > b[key]) {
      return descending ? -1 : 1;
    }
    return 0; // If values are equal, maintain the original order
  });
}

// Example Usage:
const people = [
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 22, city: "Boston" },
  { name: "David", age: 35, city: "Chicago" },
  { name: "Eve", age: 28, city: "Seattle" }
];

// Sort by age (ascending)
const sortedByAge = sortByKey(people, "age");
console.log("Sorted by age (ascending):", sortedByAge);

// Sort by name (ascending)
const sortedByName = sortByKey(people, "name");
console.log("Sorted by name (ascending):", sortedByName);

// Sort by age (descending)
const sortedByAgeDescending = sortByKey(people, "age", true);
console.log("Sorted by age (descending):", sortedByAgeDescending);
```

### **Output**

#### Sorted by Age (Ascending):
```javascript
[
  { name: "Charlie", age: 22, city: "Boston" },
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Eve", age: 28, city: "Seattle" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "David", age: 35, city: "Chicago" }
]
```

#### Sorted by Name (Ascending):
```javascript
[
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 22, city: "Boston" },
  { name: "David", age: 35, city: "Chicago" },
  { name: "Eve", age: 28, city: "Seattle" }
]
```

#### Sorted by Age (Descending):
```javascript
[
  { name: "David", age: 35, city: "Chicago" },
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, city: "San Francisco" },
  { name: "Eve", age: 28, city: "Seattle" },
  { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 22, city: "Boston" }
]
```

### **Explanation**

1. **`Array.prototype.sort()`**:
   - The `sort()` function is used to rearrange elements of the array based on a comparison function.
   - The comparison function returns:
     - A negative value if the first element should come before the second.
     - A positive value if the first element should come after the second.
     - `0` if they are equal.

2. **Comparison Logic**:
   - Compare the values for the given key (`a[key]` and `b[key]`).
   - Adjust the return value based on the `descending` flag.

3. **Stable Sorting**:
   - Equal values maintain their relative order, ensuring a **stable sort**.
