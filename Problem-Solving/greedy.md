The **Greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving technique in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) where decisions are made step-by-step by choosing the best option at the current step, with the hope that this approach leads to the global optimal solution.

### **Key Idea**
At each step:
1. Make the **locally optimal choice** (the best decision at the moment).
2. Hope that the sequence of local choices leads to a **globally optimal solution**.

Greedy algorithms do not always produce the optimal solution, but they work well for problems with specific properties (e.g., greedy choice property and optimal substructure).

### **Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms**
1. **Greedy Choice Property**:  
   A global solution can be reached by choosing the optimal solution for each subproblem.
   
2. **Optimal Substructure**:  
   A problem exhibits optimal substructure if the optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

### **Steps to Solve a Problem Using Greedy Algorithm**
1. **Identify the Problem**:
   - Ensure the problem has greedy choice property and optimal substructure.
2. **Define the Greedy Strategy**:
   - Decide what constitutes the "best choice" at each step.
3. **Iteratively Apply the Strategy**:
   - Make the greedy choice at each step and reduce the problem size.
4. **Combine Results**:
   - Combine the results of all steps to form the final solution.

### **Examples of Greedy Algorithm Problems**

#### 1. **Activity Selection Problem**  
   - Problem: Given `n` activities with start and end times, select the maximum number of activities that donâ€™t overlap.  
   - Greedy Strategy: Sort activities by end time and always select the activity that finishes the earliest and is non-overlapping.  
   - **Use Case**: Task scheduling.

#### 2. **Huffman Encoding**  
   - Problem: Build an optimal binary tree for data compression based on character frequencies.  
   - Greedy Strategy: Always combine the two lowest-frequency nodes.  
   - **Use Case**: Compression algorithms.

#### 3. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**  
   - Problem: Fill a knapsack with maximum total value when you can take fractions of items.  
   - Greedy Strategy: Take items in decreasing order of value/weight ratio.  
   - **Use Case**: Resource allocation.

#### 4. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**  
   - Problem: Find a subset of edges in a graph that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.  
   - Greedy Strategy: Use **Primâ€™s Algorithm** or **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**.  
   - **Use Case**: Network design.

#### 5. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**  
   - Problem: Find the shortest path from a source to all other nodes in a graph.  
   - Greedy Strategy: Always pick the node with the smallest distance that hasn't been processed.  
   - **Use Case**: Shortest path in weighted graphs.

### **Advantages of Greedy Algorithms**
1. Simple and easy to implement.
2. Time-efficient for certain problems (typically O(n log n) for sorting-based problems).
3. Often uses less memory compared to dynamic programming.

---

### **Disadvantages**
1. May not always yield the optimal solution for all problems.
2. Requires careful analysis to ensure the problem satisfies the greedy choice property.

### **Example Problem: Coin Change (Greedy Approach)**
- **Problem**: Given denominations of coins `[1, 5, 10, 25]` and a total value, find the minimum number of coins to make the value.
- **Greedy Strategy**: Always use the largest denomination coin available.

#### Example:
- Value = 63, Denominations = `[1, 5, 10, 25]`.
- Steps:
  1. Take one 25 (remaining: 63 - 25 = 38).
  2. Take another 25 (remaining: 38 - 25 = 13).
  3. Take one 10 (remaining: 13 - 10 = 3).
  4. Take three 1s (remaining: 3 - 3 = 0).

Solution: `[25, 25, 10, 1, 1, 1]`.

### **Conclusion**
Greedy algorithms are powerful and efficient for problems with specific properties but require careful validation. They are widely used in real-world applications like scheduling, optimization, and network design.

Hereâ€™s a program to solve the **Coin Change Problem** using the **Greedy Algorithm** in JavaScript:

### **Greedy Coin Change Algorithm**

```javascript
function coinChangeGreedy(coins, amount) {
    // Sort the coins in descending order
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let result = []; // To store the coins used
    let remainingAmount = amount; // Track the remaining amount to be made

    for (let coin of coins) {
        // Use as many coins of the current denomination as possible
        while (remainingAmount >= coin) {
            result.push(coin); // Add the coin to the result
            remainingAmount -= coin; // Decrease the remaining amount
        }
    }

    // Check if the amount was successfully made
    if (remainingAmount > 0) {
        return "The exact amount cannot be made with the given denominations.";
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const coins = [1, 5, 10, 25];
const amount = 63;

const result = coinChangeGreedy(coins, amount);
console.log("Coins used:", result);
console.log("Number of coins:", result.length);
```

---

### **Output**

#### Input:
```javascript
const coins = [1, 5, 10, 25];
const amount = 63;
```

#### Execution:
```plaintext
Coins used: [25, 25, 10, 1, 1, 1]
Number of coins: 6
```

### **How It Works**
1. **Sort the Denominations**:
   Coins are sorted in descending order to use the largest denominations first.
   
2. **Iterate Through Coins**:
   For each coin, subtract its value from the remaining amount until it cannot be subtracted further.

3. **Store the Coins Used**:
   Each coin that is subtracted is added to the `result` array.

4. **Check for Validity**:
   If the remaining amount is greater than 0 after using all denominations, it means the exact amount cannot be made with the given coins.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) (due to sorting) + O(m), where `n` is the number of coin types, and `m` is the amount.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where `k` is the number of coins used in the result.
