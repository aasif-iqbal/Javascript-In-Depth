## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
```js
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
        let len1 = word1.length;
        let len2 = word2.length;
        let result = [];
    
    for(let i=0; i< Math.max(len1, len2); i++){      
      if(i < len1){
        result.push(word1[i])
      }      
      if(i < len2){
        result.push(word2[i])
      }
    }
    return result.join(''); 
};
```

## 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings
For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + t + t + ... + t + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).

Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

 

Example 1:

Input: str1 = "ABCABC", str2 = "ABC"
Output: "ABC"

Example 2:

Input: str1 = "ABABAB", str2 = "ABAB"
Output: "AB"

Example 3:

Input: str1 = "LEET", str2 = "CODE"
Output: "" 

Constraints:

1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000

str1 and str2 consist of English uppercase letters.

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
        let temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

function gcdOfStrings(str1, str2) {
    const len1 = str1.length;
    const len2 = str2.length;
    const gcdLen = gcd(len1, len2); // Step 1: Compute GCD of lengths
    const potentialDivisor = str1.slice(0, gcdLen); // Step 2: Extract potential divisor
    
    // Step 3: Check if the potential divisor divides both strings
    if (potentialDivisor.repeat(len1 / gcdLen) === str1 && potentialDivisor.repeat(len2 / gcdLen) === str2) {
        return potentialDivisor;
    }
    return "";
}

// Examples
console.log(gcdOfStrings("ABCABC", "ABC")); // Output: "ABC"
console.log(gcdOfStrings("ABABAB", "ABAB")); // Output: "AB"
console.log(gcdOfStrings("LEET", "CODE"));   // Output: ""
```
Method 2:
```js
function gcdOfStrings(str1, str2) {
  // Helper function to calculate the GCD of two numbers
  function gcd(a, b) {
    while (b !== 0) {
      let temp = b;
      b = a % b;
      a = temp;
    }
    return a;
  }

  // Check if concatenated strings are equal
  if (str1 + str2 !== str2 + str1) {
    return "";
  }

  // Find the GCD of the lengths of str1 and str2
  let gcdLength = gcd(str1.length, str2.length);

  // Return the substring from the start of str1 up to gcdLength
  let result = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < gcdLength; i++) {
    result += str1[i];
  }
  return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(gcdOfStrings("ABCABC", "ABC"));  // Output: "ABC"
console.log(gcdOfStrings("ABABAB", "ABAB")); // Output: "AB"
console.log(gcdOfStrings("LEET", "CODE"));   // Output: ""
```

## 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
```
There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.


Example 1:

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.

Example 2:

Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.

Example 3:

Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
 

Constraints:

n == candies.length
2 <= n <= 100
1 <= candies[i] <= 100
1 <= extraCandies <= 50
```
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} candies
 * @param {number} extraCandies
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
var kidsWithCandies = function(candies, extraCandies) {
    
};
```
