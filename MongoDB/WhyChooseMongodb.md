## What is benifit of mongodb over mysql and postgress.

Great question üëç This is often asked in interviews when comparing **NoSQL (MongoDB)** with **SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**.

Here are the **benefits of MongoDB over MySQL/PostgreSQL**:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Flexible Schema (NoSQL advantage)**

* MongoDB stores data in **BSON/JSON-like documents**.
* You don‚Äôt need to pre-define a schema ‚Üí you can store different fields in different documents of the same collection.
* In SQL (MySQL/Postgres), schema is fixed and changing it requires migrations.

üìå Example:

```json
{ "name": "Aasif", "skills": ["Node.js", "MongoDB"] }
{ "name": "Ramesh", "experience": 5 }
```

Both valid in the same collection.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Horizontal Scalability & Sharding**

* MongoDB is **designed for horizontal scaling** (sharding across multiple servers).
* Easier to handle **big data and high traffic**.
* SQL databases can scale, but usually **vertically** (more CPU/RAM), which is costly.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Fast for Unstructured or Semi-structured Data**

* MongoDB is optimized for large amounts of unstructured/semi-structured data like JSON, logs, IoT, user profiles.
* SQL works better when data is **highly structured and relational**.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Built-in High Availability**

* MongoDB has **replica sets** (automatic failover and data replication).
* PostgreSQL and MySQL need additional tools (e.g., **Patroni, Galera**) for advanced replication setups.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Agile Development**

* Since schema is flexible, you can **iterate faster** in development.
* No need for schema migrations every time a new field is added.
* SQL databases need migrations and strict schema control.

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **Better for JSON APIs & Modern Applications**

* MongoDB works **natively with JSON**, which makes it perfect for REST APIs, GraphQL, microservices.
* In SQL, you must convert JSON to relational tables or use special JSON fields (Postgres supports JSONB, but still relational at core).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When SQL is Better

To be fair, **MySQL/Postgres** are often **better** when:

* You need **complex joins** & strong relational integrity.
* You need **ACID transactions** across multiple tables.
* Your data is highly structured & won‚Äôt change often.

---

‚úÖ **In Short:**

* **MongoDB** ‚Üí Best for flexible, high-scale, JSON-heavy, fast-changing applications (e.g., real-time apps, IoT, analytics, microservices).
* **MySQL/Postgres** ‚Üí Best for structured, relational, transaction-heavy apps (e.g., banking, ERP, accounting systems).

üëâ Do you want me to create a **comparison table (MongoDB vs MySQL vs Postgres)** that you can directly use in interviews?

Perfect üëå A **comparison table** will make it very clear and interview-ready.

‚úÖ **Summary in one line (interview-ready):**

* *MongoDB is best for unstructured, high-scale, JSON-heavy apps.*
* *MySQL is best for simple structured relational apps.*
* *PostgreSQL is best when you need strong relational + modern JSON features in one system.*

Do you want me to also make a **short version of this table (just 5 key differences)** that you can quickly recall in interviews?
