Great question — knowing the difference between `child_process` and `worker_threads` in Node.js helps you choose the right tool for **parallel processing**.

## 🔍 Main Difference: **Process vs Thread**

| Feature           | `child_process`                             | `worker_threads`                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**          | New **process**                             | New **thread** (in same process)              |
| **Memory**        | Has **separate memory**                     | **Shares memory** with the main thread        |
| **Communication** | Uses **IPC (message passing)**              | Uses **shared memory or message passing**     |
| **Performance**   | **Slower** due to process overhead          | **Faster** for data sharing and CPU tasks     |
| **Use Case**      | Shell commands, CPU-heavy jobs in isolation | CPU-bound tasks that need shared memory       |
| **Crash Impact**  | Crash doesn't affect main process           | Crash can bring down whole app (same process) |

## 🧠 When to Use What?

### ✅ `child_process` is better when:

* You want to **run shell commands** (like `ffmpeg`, `ls`, `python`, etc.)
* You want full **isolation** between tasks
* You're okay with **slightly slower** communication

### ✅ `worker_threads` is better when:

* You want **true parallelism** inside a Node.js app
* Tasks are **CPU-heavy** (e.g., encryption, image processing)
* You want **low-latency communication** or **shared memory**

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

### 1. `child_process`

```js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec('ls -la', (err, stdout) => {
  console.log(stdout);
});
```

### 2. `worker_threads`

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

new Worker(`
  const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
  parentPort.postMessage('Hi from worker!');
`, { eval: true }).on('message', msg => {
  console.log(msg);
});
```

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Criteria            | Use `child_process`          | Use `worker_threads`            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Shell/CLI commands  | ✅ Yes                        | ❌ No                            |
| Data sharing needed | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes (via `SharedArrayBuffer`) |
| Heavy computation   | ✅ Yes (with separate memory) | ✅ Yes (faster in same memory)   |
| Memory isolation    | ✅ Strong                     | ❌ Shared                        |
