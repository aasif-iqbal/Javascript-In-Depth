Excellent ‚Äî this is one of the most **fundamental topics** every developer should know üë®‚Äçüíª

Let‚Äôs go through the **Types of Testing in Software Development**, explained in a structured and **easy-to-remember** way üëá

## üß© 1. Based on Scope / Level of Testing

| Level                       | Description                                                                    | Example                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Unit Testing**        | Tests **individual functions or modules** in isolation.                        | Testing a `calculateTotal()` function.                          |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Integration Testing** | Tests **interaction between modules** to ensure they work together.            | Order service ‚Üí Payment service API call.                       |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ System Testing**      | Tests the **entire system as a whole** after integration.                      | Testing complete e-commerce workflow (login ‚Üí order ‚Üí payment). |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Testing**  | Done by **end users or clients** to verify if the system meets business needs. | UAT (User Acceptance Testing).                                  |

## üß™ 2. Based on Functionality

| Type                       | Description                                               | Example                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Functional Testing**     | Verifies each function of the software works as expected. | Clicking "Login" should log in user. |
| **Non-Functional Testing** | Tests performance, scalability, usability, etc.           | How fast does the site load?         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Common Functional Testing Types

| Type                   | Description                                             | Example                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Smoke Testing**      | Quick test to check basic features after deployment.    | App launches, login works.             |
| **Sanity Testing**     | Focused test after a bug fix or update.                 | Check if payment page works after fix. |
| **Regression Testing** | Ensure new code changes didn‚Äôt break existing features. | Re-run old test cases after update.    |
| **Interface Testing**  | Verify communication between systems.                   | Order ‚Üí Inventory microservice.        |
| **API Testing**        | Validate API endpoints, request/response, status codes. | Test `/api/orders` POST endpoint.      |

## ‚ö° 4. Common Non-Functional Testing Types

| Type                      | Description                                      | Example                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Performance Testing**   | Check speed, response time, stability.           | Load test with 1000 users.     |
| **Load Testing**          | Gradually increase users to see system behavior. | 500 ‚Üí 1000 ‚Üí 5000 users.       |
| **Stress Testing**        | Push system beyond limits.                       | Flood server until it crashes. |
| **Security Testing**      | Ensure app is protected against vulnerabilities. | SQL injection, XSS tests.      |
| **Usability Testing**     | Check user experience & ease of use.             | How intuitive is the UI?       |
| **Compatibility Testing** | Works on all browsers/devices.                   | Chrome, Firefox, mobile, etc.  |

## üß† 5. Other Important Testing Types

| Type                         | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alpha Testing**            | Done internally before release.                      |
| **Beta Testing**             | Done by limited real users before public release.    |
| **End-to-End Testing (E2E)** | Simulates real user workflows across the full stack. |
| **Exploratory Testing**      | No predefined test cases ‚Äî testers explore freely.   |
| **Ad-hoc Testing**           | Informal testing without structured plan.            |
| **Recovery Testing**         | Checks how app recovers from crash or failure.       |

## üß∞ 6. For Developers (especially in Node.js / TypeScript)

| Type                 | Purpose                         | Tool                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Unit Test**        | Test small logic pieces         | Jest, Mocha, Chai     |
| **Integration Test** | Test API or service interaction | Supertest, Jest       |
| **E2E Test**         | Test full user flow             | Cypress, Playwright   |
| **Load Test**        | Performance check               | Artillery, k6, JMeter |

Would you like me to show a **real example of Unit + Integration testing** for a simple Node.js API (like `POST /users`)?
That‚Äôll help you understand how these testing types look in **code**.
