### Practical patterns
- Implement a retry with exponential backoff for a failing fetch.  
- Implement a timeout wrapper: reject if an async operation exceeds N ms.  
- Implement a concurrency limiter that runs at most k async tasks at once.  
- Implement a task queue that ensures FIFO execution of async jobs.  
- Design a cancellable async operation; show approaches using AbortController or cooperative cancellation flags.
