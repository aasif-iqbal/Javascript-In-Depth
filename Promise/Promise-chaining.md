### Promise Chaining

Promise chaining is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to handle asynchronous operations sequentially by chaining multiple `.then()` methods (and optionally `.catch()` for error handling) on a Promise. It’s useful for executing tasks that depend on the results of previous asynchronous operations. Here’s how it works:

### Key Concepts
1. **Promises**: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It has three states: 
   - *Pending*: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
   - *Fulfilled*: The operation completed successfully, with a value.
   - *Rejected*: The operation failed, with a reason (error).
2. **.then()**: This method is called on a Promise and takes two optional callbacks: one for success (fulfilled) and one for failure (rejected). It returns a new Promise, enabling chaining.
3. **Chaining**: Each `.then()` returns a new Promise, allowing you to chain additional `.then()` calls to perform sequential tasks.
4. **Error Handling**: Use `.catch()` at the end of the chain to handle any errors that occur in the chain.

### How It Works
- When a Promise resolves (fulfills), the value it produces is passed to the next `.then()` in the chain.
- If a `.then()` returns a value, that value is wrapped in a new resolved Promise and passed to the next `.then()`.
- If a `.then()` returns another Promise, the chain waits for that Promise to resolve before moving to the next `.then()`.
- If any Promise in the chain rejects, the chain skips to the nearest `.catch()` for error handling.

### Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate promise chaining:

```javascript
const firstTask = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task 1: Fetching user data...");
      resolve("User: Alice");
    }, 1000);
  });
};

const secondTask = (user) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task 2: Fetching user posts...");
      resolve(`${user}'s posts: Post1, Post2`);
    }, 1000);
  });
};

const thirdTask = (posts) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Task 3: Processing posts...");
      resolve(`Processed: ${posts}`);
    }, 1000);
  });
};

// Promise chaining
firstTask()
  .then((user) => {
    console.log("Result from Task 1:", user);
    return secondTask(user); // Return a new Promise to chain
  })
  .then((posts) => {
    console.log("Result from Task 2:", posts);
    return thirdTask(posts); // Return another Promise
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Final result:", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error); // Handle any errors in the chain
  });
```

### How It Executes
1. `firstTask()` runs, waits 1 second, logs "Task 1: Fetching user data...", and resolves with "User: Alice".
2. The first `.then()` receives "User: Alice", logs it, and calls `secondTask(user)`, returning a new Promise.
3. The second `.then()` waits for `secondTask` to resolve, receives "User: Alice's posts: Post1, Post2", logs it, and calls `thirdTask(posts)`.
4. The third `.then()` waits for `thirdTask` to resolve, receives "Processed: User: Alice's posts: Post1, Post2", and logs the final result.
5. If any task rejects (e.g., due to an error), the chain jumps to `.catch()` to handle it.

### Output
After ~3 seconds (due to the sequential 1-second delays):
```
Task 1: Fetching user data...
Result from Task 1: User: Alice
Task 2: Fetching user posts...
Result from Task 2: User: Alice's posts: Post1, Post2
Task 3: Processing posts...
Final result: Processed: User: Alice's posts: Post1, Post2
```

### Key Points
- **Sequential Execution**: Each step waits for the previous Promise to resolve before proceeding.
- **Return Values**: Returning a value or a Promise in `.then()` passes it to the next `.then()`.
- **Error Propagation**: If any Promise rejects (e.g., `reject("Failed!")`), the chain skips to `.catch()`. For example, if `secondTask` rejects, the third `.then()` is skipped.
- **Async/Await Alternative**: Promise chaining can also be written more cleanly using `async/await`, but chaining is still widely used for its clarity in some cases.

### Error Handling Example
Modify `secondTask` to reject:
```javascript
const secondTask = (user) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject("Error: Failed to fetch posts!");
    }, 1000);
  });
};
```
Now the output would be:
```
Task 1: Fetching user data...
Result from Task 1: User: Alice
Error: Failed to fetch posts!
```
The chain stops at the rejection and jumps to `.catch()`.

### Why Use Chaining?
- Ensures tasks run in order, especially when later tasks depend on earlier results (e.g., fetch user, then fetch posts, then process).
- Makes asynchronous code readable and manageable.
- Centralizes error handling with `.catch()`.
