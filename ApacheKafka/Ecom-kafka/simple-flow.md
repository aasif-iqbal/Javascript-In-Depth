Nice — here’s a clear, practical **step-by-step workflow** you can follow to implement the e-commerce Order → Inventory flow with Kafka. I’ll include the sequence, message shapes, failure-handling recommendations, and an implementation checklist so you can copy/paste into your project.

# Step-by-step workflow (high level)

1. Customer submits order (HTTP POST /orders) → Order Service.
2. Order Service creates an order record with status `PENDING` (persist to DB).
3. Order Service publishes an `OrderCreated` event to `orders-topic` (key = orderId).
4. Inventory Service (Kafka consumer) receives `OrderCreated`, checks stock for each item.
5. If stock available:

   * Inventory Service deducts stock (persist inventory change).
   * Inventory Service publishes `InventoryUpdated` event with `status: CONFIRMED` to `inventory-topic`.
6. If stock not available:

   * Inventory Service publishes `InventoryUpdated` event with `status: OUT_OF_STOCK` (and optionally list missing items).
7. Order Service (consumer of `inventory-topic`) receives `InventoryUpdated` event and updates order status to `CONFIRMED` or `OUT_OF_STOCK`.
8. Order Service returns final response to customer (if synchronous path used) or customer can poll/receive updates via websocket/notifications.

# Detailed step-by-step (with actions and checks)

### 1 — Create Order (API)

* Endpoint: `POST /orders`
* Validate payload (items, quantities, userId, payment method).
* Create DB record:

  * `orderId`, `userId`, `items[]`, `total`, `status: PENDING`, `createdAt`.
* Persist immediately so there’s a durable record before producing event.
* Produce `OrderCreated` event (see message schema below).
* Return HTTP 201 with `{ orderId, status: PENDING }` to user.

### 2 — Produce `OrderCreated` event

* Use Kafka producer; set message key = `orderId` (ensures partition-affinity).
* Optionally make the producer transactional if you want atomicity between DB write and Kafka produce (two-phase commit via Kafka transactions). If not using transactions, make sure you handle the rare DB-write + produce failure (see idempotency).
* Message should be small — include references and minimal necessary data; avoid embedding large objects.

### 3 — Inventory Service consumes `orders-topic`

* Consumer group: `inventory-service-group`.
* Subscribe to `orders-topic` (from last committed offset).
* On message:

  * Parse payload.
  * Perform idempotency check: if `orderId` already processed, ignore (store processed orderIds or use DB flag).
  * For each item:

    * Check `availableQuantity >= requested`.
  * If all available:

    * Deduct stock in DB within a transaction.
    * Publish `InventoryUpdated {orderId, status: CONFIRMED, items: [...]}`.
  * If any missing:

    * Do not deduct. Publish `InventoryUpdated {orderId, status: OUT_OF_STOCK, missingItems: [...]}`.

### 4 — Publish `InventoryUpdated` event

* Key = `orderId` to keep ordering.
* Consider using a separate `inventory-topic` or a single events topic with eventType field.
* Optionally include `traceId`/`correlationId` for observability.

### 5 — Order Service consumes `inventory-topic`

* Consumer group: `order-service-group`.
* On `InventoryUpdated`:

  * Verify event signature / schema.
  * Update order status in DB:

    * `PENDING` → `CONFIRMED` or `OUT_OF_STOCK`.
  * Optionally trigger downstream actions:

    * If `CONFIRMED`: send confirmation email, reserve shipping slot, charge payment if not charged earlier.
    * If `OUT_OF_STOCK`: notify customer, offer refund or backorder.
* Emit metrics/logs for each state transition.

# Message schemas (JSON examples)

`OrderCreated` (published by Order Service)

```json
{
  "eventType": "OrderCreated",
  "orderId": "uuid-1234",
  "userId": "user-42",
  "items": [
    { "sku": "laptop-01", "qty": 1 },
    { "sku": "phone-05",  "qty": 2 }
  ],
  "total": 3499.99,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-24T06:00:00Z",
  "traceId": "trace-789"
}
```

`InventoryUpdated` (published by Inventory Service)

```json
{
  "eventType": "InventoryUpdated",
  "orderId": "uuid-1234",
  "status": "CONFIRMED", // or "OUT_OF_STOCK"
  "missingItems": [],    // present if OUT_OF_STOCK
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-24T06:00:02Z",
  "traceId": "trace-789"
}
```

# Failure modes & handling

* **Producer publish fails after DB write**

  * Option 1: Use Kafka transactions (if using KafkaJS + Kafka config) to atomically commit DB and Kafka (complex).
  * Option 2: Persist an `outbox` table row with event payload and run a background worker to reliably publish outbox → Kafka (outbox pattern).
* **Consumer processing fails mid-way**

  * Use idempotency (store processed `orderId`) so reprocessing is safe.
  * Use Kafka consumer commit only after processing and publishing follow-up events.
* **Inventory deduction fails due to race conditions**

  * Use DB row-level locking or optimistic concurrency (compare-and-swap on `availableQuantity`).
* **Poison messages / bad payload**

  * Validate schema before processing; if invalid, route message to a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) topic and alert team.
* **Network / broker down**

  * Implement retry with exponential backoff for produces and consumes.
  * Monitor consumer lag metrics and set alerts.

# Idempotency & ordering

* **Idempotency:** store `processedEventIds` or `lastProcessedOffset` per order to avoid double-deduction.
* **Ordering:** use `orderId` as key so all messages for the same order go to the same partition (ensures ordering for that order).
* **Exactly-once semantics:** Kafka supports transactional producers and EOS, but requires careful setup (and compatible consumer/producer libraries). For many systems, idempotent processing is simpler and robust.

# Topic design & configuration (recommendations)

* `orders-topic` — partition by `orderId`, retention as needed (e.g., 7d or longer for replay).
* `inventory-topic` — partition by `orderId`.
* Use replication factor >=2 for fault tolerance.
* For high throughput, choose partition count based on consumer parallelism.

# Observability & monitoring

* Emit metrics:

  * Orders created/sec, Inventory checks/sec, Confirmed orders/sec, Out-of-stock/sec.
  * Kafka consumer lag per partition.
* Logs with `traceId` for tracing.
* Alerts:

  * Consumer lag > threshold.
  * DLQ message count > 0.
  * High error rate in Inventory Service.

# Security

* Encrypt topics in transit (TLS).
* Use Kafka ACLs: allow Order Service only to produce to `orders-topic` and consume `inventory-topic`; Inventory Service only to consume `orders-topic` and produce `inventory-topic`.

# Implementation checklist (practical)

* [ ] Create topics: `orders-topic`, `inventory-topic` with appropriate partitions & replication.
* [ ] Implement Order Service:

  * [ ] POST `/orders` with DB write (status=PENDING).
  * [ ] Kafka producer to publish `OrderCreated`.
  * [ ] Consumer to listen to `InventoryUpdated` and update DB.
  * [ ] Idempotency guards.
* [ ] Implement Inventory Service:

  * [ ] Consumer for `orders-topic`.
  * [ ] Check/deduct stock with DB transactions.
  * [ ] Publish `InventoryUpdated`.
  * [ ] Idempotency guards.
* [ ] Add DLQ and outbox pattern if needed.
* [ ] Add metrics/tracing (Prometheus + Jaeger or equivalent).
* [ ] Add retry/backoff + alerts.
* [ ] Implement safe shutdowns (commit offsets cleanly).

# Quick sequence summary (compact)

1. `POST /orders` → Order created in DB (`PENDING`) → send `OrderCreated` → Kafka `orders-topic`.
2. Inventory consumer reads `OrderCreated`, checks stock → update DB inventory → send `InventoryUpdated` → Kafka `inventory-topic`.
3. Order consumer reads `InventoryUpdated` → update order status to `CONFIRMED` / `OUT_OF_STOCK` → downstream actions.
