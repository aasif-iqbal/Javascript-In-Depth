# Closure working
Great question! Let's dive into **how closures work in JavaScript**, especially in the context of real use cases (like Node.js development, timers, or function factories).

---

## 🔍 What is a Closure?

A **closure** is a function that:

> ✅ **"Remembers" the variables from its lexical scope even after that outer function has finished executing.**

---

### 🔧 **Basic Example:**

```js
function outer() {
  let name = 'Aasif';

  function inner() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + name); // 🧠 remembers `name`
  }

  return inner;
}

const greet = outer(); // outer() is done executing
greet(); // 👉 Hello, Aasif (still remembers `name`)
```

Even though `outer()` has finished executing, `inner()` still has access to `name` — that's a closure.

---

## 🔁 Real-World Use Cases

---

### 1. **Data Privacy (Encapsulation)**

Closures help simulate private variables in JavaScript (since JS doesn’t have private scope like other languages):

```js
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return {
    increment: () => ++count,
    decrement: () => --count,
    get: () => count
  };
}

const c = counter();
console.log(c.increment()); // 1
console.log(c.get());       // 1
console.log(c.decrement()); // 0
```

✅ `count` is private — it can't be accessed directly.

---

### 2. **Asynchronous Code (e.g. Timers or Loops)**

Closures help **capture variable values** correctly in async operations:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i); // ❌ prints 4 three times (due to var hoisting)
  }, 1000);
}
```

Fix with closure:

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  (function (x) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(x); // ✅ 1, 2, 3
    }, 1000);
  })(i);
}
```

Or just use `let` (which creates a new binding each time):

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i); // ✅ 1, 2, 3
  }, 1000);
}
```

---

### 3. **Function Factories (Dynamic Function Creators)**

Closures allow you to create **customized functions**:

```js
function makeMultiplier(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = makeMultiplier(2);
const triple = makeMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15
```

✅ Each returned function **remembers** its own `factor`.

---

### 4. **In Node.js Modules**

```js
// logger.js
function createLogger(serviceName) {
  return function (message) {
    console.log(`[${serviceName}] ${message}`);
  };
}

module.exports = createLogger;

// app.js
const logger = require('./logger');

const authLogger = logger('Auth');
authLogger('User logged in'); // [Auth] User logged in
```

✅ `authLogger` is a closure over `serviceName`.

---

## 🧠 How It Works Under the Hood

JavaScript **stores a function along with its lexical environment**. When the function is called later, it still has access to the variables that were in scope when it was defined — not when it’s called.

---

## 🔐 Summary

| Feature           | Benefit                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Private data      | Avoid exposing internal variables |
| Async safety      | Capture values during loops, timers |
| Dynamic functions | Build factories, currying, etc. |
| Modular code      | Helps keep state clean in Node.js |

# Lexical Scope
Absolutely! Let’s break down **lexical scope** in super simple terms:

---

### 🧠 **Lexical Scope = Where a variable is defined in the code.**

That’s it!

It means:

> A function **can access variables from the place (scope) where it was written** — not from where it’s called.

---

### 📦 Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let name = 'Aasif';

  function inner() {
    console.log(name); // 👈 this works!
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

✅ `inner()` can access `name` because it was **written inside `outer()`**.

That’s **lexical scope** — variables are accessible **based on the location in the source code**, not runtime behavior.

---

### 🚫 Not based on where it's *called*:

```js
function outer() {
  let secret = 'Top secret';

  return function inner() {
    console.log(secret);
  };
}

const f = outer(); // `secret` is in lexical scope of `inner`
f(); // ✅ still prints 'Top secret' because of lexical scope
```

Even though `f()` is called outside `outer()`, it still **remembers** `secret` because of **where it was defined** — that's lexical scope in action.

---

### 🔑 In Simple Terms:
Think of lexical scope as:
> “Where was this function **born** in the code?”

That determines what variables it has access to.
