Here's another **tricky JavaScript problem** involving **`this`**, **arrow functions**, and **object methods**.

---

### Problem:
What will be the output of the following code?

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "JavaScript",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(this.name);
    }, 1000);
  }
};

obj.greet();
```

---

### Options:
1. `JavaScript` followed by `undefined`
2. `JavaScript` followed by `JavaScript`
3. `undefined` followed by `undefined`
4. `JavaScript` followed by an error

Think about how the value of `this` behaves inside regular functions versus arrow functions. Let me know your answer, and I'll explain it! ðŸ˜„

Output: 2

The correct answer is **2: `JavaScript` followed by `JavaScript`**. Here's why:

### Explanation:

1. **Inside `greet()` method**:
   - `greet` is a regular method in the object `obj`.
   - The `this` keyword inside a regular function refers to the object that calls the method. In this case, `this` refers to `obj`, and `obj.name` is `"JavaScript"`.
   - So, the first `console.log(this.name)` prints `"JavaScript"`.

2. **Inside `setTimeout()` with an arrow function**:
   - Arrow functions **do not have their own `this`**. Instead, they "capture" the value of `this` from their **lexical context** (the surrounding function or object where they were defined).
   - In this case, the arrow function inside `setTimeout` is defined within the `greet` method, so it captures `this` from that method, which is the `obj` object.
   - Therefore, when the `setTimeout` callback executes after 1 second, it still has access to `this.name`, which is `"JavaScript"`, and it prints `"JavaScript"` again.

### What Happens If We Used a Regular Function Inside `setTimeout`?

If we had used a **regular function** inside the `setTimeout` instead of an arrow function, the value of `this` would be different. It would refer to the **global object** (in non-strict mode, `this` would refer to the `window` object in browsers), and thus `this.name` would be `undefined`:

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "JavaScript",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(this.name);  // "JavaScript"
    
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(this.name);  // undefined, because 'this' refers to the global object
    }, 1000);
  }
};

obj.greet();
```

**Output**:
```
JavaScript
undefined
```

### Key Takeaways:
1. **`this` in regular functions** refers to the object that calls the function, but **`this` in arrow functions** retains the value of `this` from the surrounding context.
2. Arrow functions are particularly useful when you want to retain the value of `this` from the outer scope, such as in callbacks like `setTimeout`.
