Let’s solve this problem step by step in JavaScript. The task is to calculate the total marks for each student after ignoring the subject with the lowest class average. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

- **Input 1**: `N` (number of students)
- **Input 2**: `M` (number of subjects)
- **Input 3**: A 2D array of size `N x M` containing the marks of all students in each subject.
- **Task**: 
  1. Find the subject with the lowest class average.
  2. Ignore that subject for all students.
  3. Calculate the total marks for each student from the remaining subjects.
- **Output**: An array of size `N` containing the total marks for each student after ignoring the subject with the lowest average.

### Solution Approach
1. **Calculate the average marks for each subject**:
   - Iterate through the 2D array to sum up the marks for each subject across all students.
   - Divide by the number of students (`N`) to get the average for each subject.
2. **Identify the subject with the lowest average**:
   - Compare the averages and find the index of the subject with the minimum average.
3. **Calculate total marks for each student**:
   - For each student, sum their marks across all subjects except the one with the lowest average.
4. **Return the result**:
   - Return an array containing the total marks for each student.

### JavaScript Code
```javascript
function calculateTotalMarks(N, M, marks) {
    // Step 1: Calculate the average marks for each subject
    let subjectSums = new Array(M).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            subjectSums[j] += marks[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    let subjectAverages = subjectSums.map(sum => sum / N);
    
    // Step 2: Find the subject with the lowest average
    let minAvg = subjectAverages[0];
    let minAvgSubjectIndex = 0;
    for (let j = 1; j < M; j++) {
        if (subjectAverages[j] < minAvg) {
            minAvg = subjectAverages[j];
            minAvgSubjectIndex = j;
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Calculate total marks for each student, ignoring the subject with lowest average
    let result = new Array(N).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            if (j !== minAvgSubjectIndex) {
                result[i] += marks[i][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let N = 3; // Number of students
let M = 3; // Number of subjects
let marks = [
    [50, 60, 70], // Student 1
    [80, 85, 90], // Student 2
    [20, 30, 40]  // Student 3
];

let result = calculateTotalMarks(N, M, marks);
console.log(result); // Output: [130, 175, 70]
```

### Explanation of the Example
- **Marks Array**:
  - Student 1: [50, 60, 70]
  - Student 2: [80, 85, 90]
  - Student 3: [20, 30, 40]
- **Step 1: Calculate subject averages**:
  - Subject 1: (50 + 80 + 20) / 3 = 150 / 3 = 50
  - Subject 2: (60 + 85 + 30) / 3 = 175 / 3 ≈ 58.33
  - Subject 3: (70 + 90 + 40) / 3 = 200 / 3 ≈ 66.67
- **Step 2: Find the subject with the lowest average**:
  - Subject 1 has the lowest average (50).
- **Step 3: Calculate total marks ignoring Subject 1**:
  - Student 1: 60 + 70 = 130
  - Student 2: 85 + 90 = 175
  - Student 3: 30 + 40 = 70
- **Output**: [130, 175, 70]

This solution handles the problem efficiently with a time complexity of O(N*M), where N is the number of students and M is the number of subjects. Let me know if you need further clarification!



=======================

Let’s solve this problem in JavaScript. The task is to find the shortest substring of a given string (`input1`) that contains all the characters of another string (`input2`). This is a classic "minimum window substring" problem, and we can solve it efficiently using the sliding window technique.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Input 1**: A string (`input1`), e.g., "My Name is Fran".
- **Input 2**: A string (`input2`) containing characters to be mapped, e.g., "rim".
- **Task**: Find the shortest substring in `input1` that contains all characters of `input2` 
(in any order).
- **Output**: The shortest substring. For the example, the output is "me is Fr", as it contains 'r', 'i', and 'm' and is the shortest such substring.

### Solution Approach
We’ll use the sliding window technique:
1. **Track the required characters**:
   - Create a frequency map of characters in `input2` to know what we need to find.
2. **Slide the window**:
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to form a window in `input1`.
   - Expand the window by moving `right` until all required characters are found.
   - Once a valid window is found, shrink it from the `left` to minimize its size while ensuring it still contains all required characters.
3. **Keep track of the shortest window**:
   - Update the result whenever a smaller valid window is found.
4. **Return the result**:
   - Return the shortest substring that satisfies the condition.

### JavaScript Code
```javascript
function findShortestSubstring(input1, input2) {
    // Step 1: Create a frequency map for characters in input2
    let charMap = new Map();
    for (let char of input2) {
        charMap.set(char, charMap.get(char) + 1 || 1);
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize variables for the sliding window
    let required = charMap.size; // Number of unique characters to match
    let formed = 0; // Number of unique characters currently matched
    let windowCounts = new Map(); // Frequency map for the current window

    let left = 0, right = 0;
    let minLen = Infinity, minLeft = 0, minRight = 0;

    // Step 3: Slide the window
    while (right < input1.length) {
        // Add the current character to the window
        let charRight = input1[right];
        windowCounts.set(charRight, (windowCounts.get(charRight) || 0) + 1);

        // Check if this character contributes to forming the required substring
        if (charMap.has(charRight) && windowCounts.get(charRight) === charMap.get(charRight)) {
            formed++;
        }

        // Step 4: Shrink the window from the left as much as possible
        while (left <= right && formed === required) {
            let charLeft = input1[left];

            // Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller
            if (right - left + 1 < minLen) {
                minLen = right - left + 1;
                minLeft = left;
                minRight = right;
            }

            // Remove the leftmost character from the window
            windowCounts.set(charLeft, windowCounts.get(charLeft) - 1);
            if (charMap.has(charLeft) && windowCounts.get(charLeft) < charMap.get(charLeft)) {
                formed--;
            }

            left++;
        }

        right++;
    }

    // Step 5: Return the result
    if (minLen === Infinity) {
        return ""; // No valid substring found
    }
    return input1.substring(minLeft, minRight + 1);
}

// Example usage:
let input1 = "My Name is Fran";
let input2 = "rim";
let result = findShortestSubstring(input1, input2);
console.log(result); // Output: "me is Fr"
```

### Explanation of the Example
- **Input 1**: "My Name is Fran"
- **Input 2**: "rim"
- **Required Characters**: We need to find a substring that contains 'r', 'i', and 'm'.
- **Sliding Window Process**:
  - Start with a window and expand `right` until all characters ('r', 'i', 'm') are found.
  - The first valid window might be "My Name is Fr", which contains 'r' (in "My" and "Fr"), 'i' (in "is"), and 'm' (in "Name").
  - Shrink from the left: "My N" doesn’t contain all characters (missing 'i'), but eventually, we find "me is Fr" as the shortest substring:
    - 'm' in "me"
    - 'i' in "is"
    - 'r' in "Fr"
- **Output**: "me is Fr" (length 8), which is the shortest substring containing all characters of "rim".

### Edge Cases Handled
- If no substring contains all characters, the function returns an empty string.
- The solution works with repeated characters in `input2` (e.g., if `input2` is "rrm", it ensures two 'r's and one 'm' are present).
- Case sensitivity is maintained as per the problem (e.g., 'R' and 'r' are treated as different characters).

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(|S|), where |S| is the length of `input1`. We traverse the string with two pointers, and each character is added and removed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(|T| + |S|), where |T| is the length of `input2` (for the character map) and |S| is the length of `input1` (for the window counts).

Let me know if you need further clarification!

============= Simple way =================

Let’s simplify the solution for finding the shortest substring in `input1` that contains all characters of `input2` using a more straightforward approach in JavaScript. We’ll still use the sliding window technique, but we’ll focus on making the code easier to understand while keeping it efficient.

### Simplified Approach
1. **Count characters in `input2`**: We need to know how many of each character we’re looking for.
2. **Use a sliding window**:
   - Expand the window (move the `right` pointer) to include characters until we have all the required ones.
   - Shrink the window (move the `left` pointer) to find the smallest window that still works.
3. **Track the smallest window**: Keep updating the shortest substring whenever we find a smaller valid window.

### Simplified JavaScript Code
```javascript
function findShortestSubstring(input1, input2) {
    // Step 1: Count characters in input2
    let need = {};
    for (let char of input2) {
        need[char] = (need[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    let needCount = Object.keys(need).length; // Unique characters to find

    // Step 2: Sliding window
    let have = {};
    let haveCount = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let minLen = Infinity;
    let minWindow = "";

    for (let right = 0; right < input1.length; right++) {
        let char = input1[right];
        
        // Add the current character to the window
        have[char] = (have[char] || 0) + 1;

        // Check if this character helps meet the requirement
        if (need[char] && have[char] === need[char]) {
            haveCount++;
        }

        // Step 3: Shrink the window while it still has all required characters
        while (haveCount === needCount) {
            // Update the smallest window
            let currentLen = right - left + 1;
            if (currentLen < minLen) {
                minLen = currentLen;
                minWindow = input1.slice(left, right + 1);
            }

            // Remove the leftmost character
            let leftChar = input1[left];
            have[leftChar]--;
            if (need[leftChar] && have[leftChar] < need[leftChar]) {
                haveCount--;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minWindow;
}

// Example usage:
let input1 = "My Name is Fran";
let input2 = "rim";
let result = findShortestSubstring(input1, input2);
console.log(result); // Output: "me is Fr"
```

### How It Works
- **Character Count**:
  - `need` stores the count of each character in `input2` (e.g., `{ r: 1, i: 1, m: 1 }`).
  - `needCount` is the number of unique characters we need to match (3 for "rim").
- **Sliding Window**:
  - `have` tracks the count of characters in the current window.
  - `haveCount` tracks how many unique characters in the window match the required counts.
  - Expand the window by moving `right`, and shrink it by moving `left` when we have all characters.
- **Track the Smallest Window**:
  - Whenever the window contains all characters (`haveCount === needCount`), check if it’s the smallest so far.
  - Update `minWindow` with the current substring if it’s shorter.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Input 1**: "My Name is Fran"
- **Input 2**: "rim"
- **Need**: `{ r: 1, i: 1, m: 1 }`, `needCount = 3`
- **Process**:
  - Move `right` until the window has 'r', 'i', and 'm'. The first valid window is "My Name is Fr".
  - Shrink from the left: After removing "My N", the window "ame is Fr" still has all characters.
  - Keep shrinking: "me is Fr" is the smallest window (length 8) that contains 'm', 'i', and 'r'.
- **Output**: "me is Fr"

### Why It’s Simpler
- We use plain objects (`{}`) instead of `Map` for character counts, which is more intuitive.
- The logic focuses on counting matches (`haveCount` vs. `needCount`) rather than complex comparisons.
- The code avoids extra variables and focuses on the core idea of expanding and shrinking the window.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(|S|), where |S| is the length of `input1`. Each character is added and removed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(|T|), where |T| is the length of `input2`, for storing character counts.
