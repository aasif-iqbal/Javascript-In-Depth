### How much dsa questions are enough to crack coding rounds.

The number of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions** you need to solve to crack coding rounds depends on your **target company, role, and problem-solving ability**. However, here’s a structured approach to gauge readiness:  

### **General Guideline Based on Difficulty Level**  
1. **Easy Questions** → 50–100 (Basic concepts, syntax, and problem-solving techniques)  
2. **Medium Questions** → 150–250 (Standard coding round questions, pattern recognition)  
3. **Hard Questions** → 50–100 (Competitive programming, advanced problem-solving)  

### **Total Questions Needed Based on Target**  
- **Service-Based Companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Cognizant, etc.)** → 100–150  
- **Product-Based Companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, etc.)** → 200–300  
- **FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, etc.)** → 350–500  

### **Category-Wise Breakdown (Recommended Topics & Number of Questions)**  
| **Topic**            | **Minimum Questions** |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Arrays & Strings     | 50–70 |
| Linked List          | 30–50 |
| Stacks & Queues      | 30–50 |
| Hashing & Maps       | 20–40 |
| Recursion & Backtracking | 40–60 |
| Binary Trees & BST   | 50–70 |
| Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST) | 50–80 |
| Dynamic Programming  | 50–100 |
| Greedy Algorithms    | 20–40 |
| Bit Manipulation     | 10–20 |

### **How to Approach Preparation?**  
1. **Start with Easy Problems** (Leetcode Easy, GFG, InterviewBit)  
2. **Move to Medium Problems** (Most coding rounds consist of these)  
3. **Solve Hard Questions** (Only if aiming for top companies)  
4. **Focus on Patterns** – Many problems have similar patterns.  
5. **Mock Interviews & Contests** – Simulate real-time interview experience.  

### **Key Resources**  
- **LeetCode (Best for FAANG)** → Focus on Top 150/200 Interview Questions  
- **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** → Company-specific problems  
- **Codeforces, Atcoder, CodeChef** → For advanced problem-solving  
- **Neetcode.io, Striver’s SDE Sheet, Love Babbar’s 450 DSA Sheet** → Structured Roadmaps  

### **Final Answer**  
If you solve **200–300 well-chosen questions**, covering **all major DSA topics**, you’ll have a high chance of clearing coding rounds for most companies. However, **consistency & problem-solving ability** matter more than just numbers.
