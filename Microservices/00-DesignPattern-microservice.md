Excellent question — this is **one of the most important topics** for designing robust microservices systems.

Let’s go through the **most common and practical design patterns** used in **Microservices Architecture**, grouped by category 👇

---

## 🧩 **1. Decomposition Patterns**

These patterns help in **breaking down a monolith** into smaller, manageable microservices.

### 🔹 a) **Decompose by Business Capability**

* Each service corresponds to a specific **business function** (e.g., *User Service*, *Order Service*, *Payment Service*).
* Helps maintain clear ownership and separation of concerns.

**Example:**

```text
E-commerce app:
- Order Service → Handles order creation, tracking
- Payment Service → Handles transactions
- Inventory Service → Manages stock
```

### 🔹 b) **Decompose by Subdomain (DDD)**

* Based on **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts — divide system into **bounded contexts**.
* Each bounded context becomes a service.

---

## 🔄 **2. Integration Patterns**

These define **how services communicate** with each other.

### 🔹 a) **API Gateway Pattern**

* A single entry point for all client requests.
* Routes requests to respective microservices.
* Handles **authentication, logging, rate limiting, aggregation**, etc.

**Example stack:**
AWS API Gateway, NGINX, Kong, or Express Gateway.

```text
Client → API Gateway → User / Order / Payment services
```

### 🔹 b) **Aggregator Pattern**

* The gateway or a composite service aggregates responses from multiple microservices into a single response.

```js
// Example pseudo code
const user = await userService.getUser(id);
const orders = await orderService.getOrders(id);
return { ...user, orders };
```

### 🔹 c) **Saga Pattern**

* Used to **maintain data consistency** across services (especially in distributed transactions).
* Each service performs a local transaction and publishes an event for the next action.
* Can be implemented as:

  * **Choreography** (event-driven, decentralized)
  * **Orchestration** (central coordinator)

**Example:**

> Place Order → Reserve Inventory → Process Payment → Confirm Order
> If payment fails → rollback inventory → cancel order

## 💾 **3. Database Patterns**

Microservices **shouldn’t share databases**, but we need ways to manage distributed data.

### 🔹 a) **Database per Service**

* Each service owns its own database.
* Ensures **loose coupling**.
* But makes transactions across services harder.

### 🔹 b) **Shared Database**

* Multiple services share one database (not ideal for large-scale systems).
* Easier for small apps or early development.

### 🔹 c) **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**

* Split **read** and **write** operations into different models.
* Write → normalized data.
* Read → denormalized data for faster queries.

### 🔹 d) **Event Sourcing**

* Instead of storing just current state, store all **events** that led to the current state.
* Can rebuild state anytime.
* Often used with CQRS.

---

## 📦 **4. Communication Patterns**

How services talk to each other — **synchronous** or **asynchronous**.

### 🔹 a) **Request-Response Pattern**

* Simple REST or gRPC calls between services.
* Works well for quick, reliable responses.

### 🔹 b) **Event-Driven Pattern**

* Services communicate via events (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams).
* Enables loose coupling and scalability.
* Example:
  `OrderPlaced → InventoryService → PaymentService`

---

## 🧠 **5. Resilience Patterns**

Ensure the system remains stable even when parts fail.

### 🔹 a) **Circuit Breaker**

* Prevents cascading failures.
* If a service keeps failing, circuit “opens” to stop further requests temporarily.

**Library example:**
`resilience4j`, `Hystrix`

### 🔹 b) **Retry Pattern**

* Automatically retry failed requests after a delay.

### 🔹 c) **Bulkhead Pattern**

* Isolate resources (like threads or DB connections) for each service or module.
* Prevents one failing service from affecting others.

### 🔹 d) **Timeout Pattern**

* Set request timeouts to avoid waiting forever for unresponsive services.

---

## 🧭 **6. Observability Patterns**

To monitor and debug distributed services.

### 🔹 a) **Centralized Logging**

* Collect logs from all services into one system (e.g., **ELK stack**, **AWS CloudWatch**, **Grafana Loki**).

### 🔹 b) **Distributed Tracing**

* Track request flow across services.
* Tools: **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**, **AWS X-Ray**

### 🔹 c) **Health Check API**

* Each service exposes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring.

---

## 🧰 **7. Deployment Patterns**

### 🔹 a) **Service Discovery**

* Automatically find services (use **Eureka**, **Consul**, or **Kubernetes DNS**).

### 🔹 b) **Sidecar Pattern**

* Run helper containers alongside your main service (for logging, proxy, etc.).
* Common in **Kubernetes** and **Service Mesh (Istio)** setups.
