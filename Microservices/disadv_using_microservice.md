The primary disadvantages of using or creating microservices are increased system complexity, communication overhead, and operational challenges. Microservices can introduce a range of technical and organizational issues that must be managed carefully.[2][3][7]

### Major Disadvantages of Microservices

- **Increased Complexity:** Managing multiple independent services is far more complex than handling a monolithic application. Each service must be separately developed, deployed, scaled, and monitored, often resulting in significant orchestration and coordination effort.[3][5][2]
- **Communication Overhead:** Microservices rely on inter-service networking via APIs, which introduces network latency, additional failure points, and serialization/deserialization overhead. This can degrade performance compared to local, in-process calls in monolithic architectures.[5][8][3]
- **Testing and Debugging Challenges:** Testing microservices, especially integration scenarios involving multiple interdependent services, is more difficult. Debugging distributed systems also requires gathering and correlating logs across various services.[6][5]
- **Deployment and Versioning Issues:** Coordinating deployments among services, maintaining backward compatibility, and versioning APIs add operational burden.[2][5]
- **Data Consistency Issues:** Ensuring data consistency and handling distributed transactions across services (each with its own datastore) is difficult, sometimes requiring complex consistency patterns or eventual consistency approaches.[3][2]
- **Higher Operational and Maintenance Costs:** Each service requires resources and infrastructure, leading to higher overhead in provisioning, monitoring, and maintaining environments for potentially dozens of services.[7][8]
- **Security Concerns:** More services mean a larger attack surface, as communication is often over the network. Secure communication, authentication, and authorization must be managed across all services.[4][7]
- **Organizational and Team Overhead:** Coordinating work across multiple teams, each responsible for different services, can slow delivery and add bureaucratic friction if not managed well.[7]

In summary, microservices trade simplicity and centralized management of monoliths for increased modularity, independence, and scalabilityâ€”but at the cost of greater technical, operational, and organizational complexity.[4][2][3]
