Excellent — let’s go deep into **Event Sourcing**, one of the most powerful (yet sometimes misunderstood) architectural patterns, often used with **CQRS**.

---

## 🧠 1. What Is Event Sourcing?

**Event Sourcing** is an architectural pattern where you **store all the changes (events)** that happen to an application’s state, **instead of storing only the latest state**.

In other words:

> 💬 *Don’t store just the data — store every event that led to that data.*

---

### 📊 Example

Let’s take a simple example: a **Bank Account**.

#### Traditional Approach (State-Oriented)

You store the final state:

```json
{
  "accountId": 101,
  "balance": 800
}
```

If you want to know how it got there, the database can’t tell you.

#### Event Sourcing Approach

You store **each event** that changed the balance:

| Event          | Data                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AccountCreated | { "accountId": 101, "balance": 0 }   |
| MoneyDeposited | { "accountId": 101, "amount": 1000 } |
| MoneyWithdrawn | { "accountId": 101, "amount": 200 }  |

Now, if you replay all these events:

```
0 + 1000 - 200 = 800
```

👉 The final balance = **800**, but you also have the *entire history* of how you got there.

---

## ⚙️ 2. How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **Command is received**

   * Example: “Deposit ₹1000”

2. **Command Handler validates it**

   * Checks business rules (e.g., account exists, user authorized)

3. **Event is created and stored**

   * Example: `MoneyDeposited { accountId: 101, amount: 1000 }`

4. **Event is published**

   * Other parts of the system can react (e.g., update reports, send notifications)

5. **State is rebuilt by replaying events**

   * The current state is the sum of all past events.

## 🧩 3. Event Sourcing vs Traditional Storage

| Feature      | Traditional (CRUD)              | Event Sourcing         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Data Storage | Stores final state              | Stores all events      |
| History      | Lost (unless logged separately) | Complete event history |
| Audit Trail  | Partial                         | Full and automatic     |
| Recovery     | From last snapshot              | From event replay      |
| Read Model   | Same as write                   | Can be separate (CQRS) |

---

## 🏗️ 4. Architecture Overview

Here’s a high-level structure:

```
[Client]
   ↓
[Command API]
   ↓
[Command Handler]
   ↓
[Event Store] ← stores all events
   ↓
[Event Bus] → publishes to subscribers
   ↓
[Read Model Updater]
   ↓
[Read Database] ← used by Query API
```

So, your **write side** focuses on storing events,
while the **read side** builds fast query views from those events.

---

## 💾 5. Event Store

Instead of a normal relational DB table, you have an **Event Store**, which acts like an append-only log.

### Example Event Store Entry

```json
{
  "id": "evt-12345",
  "aggregateId": "acc-101",
  "eventType": "MoneyDeposited",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T09:00:00Z",
  "data": { "amount": 1000 }
}
```

🟢 Each aggregate (like a specific Account) has its own event stream:

```
acc-101:
  1. AccountCreated
  2. MoneyDeposited
  3. MoneyWithdrawn
```

---

## 🧮 6. Rebuilding State from Events

You can **rebuild the entire system state** anytime by replaying events.

```js
let balance = 0;
for (const event of accountEvents) {
  if (event.type === 'MoneyDeposited') balance += event.data.amount;
  if (event.type === 'MoneyWithdrawn') balance -= event.data.amount;
}
console.log(balance); // final state
```

You can also **take periodic snapshots** (e.g., every 100 events) to speed up replay.

---

## 📦 7. Example (Node.js Concept)

Here’s a simple sketch of Event Sourcing logic:

```js
// eventStore.js
const events = [];

export function saveEvent(event) {
  events.push(event);
}

export function getEventsByAggregateId(id) {
  return events.filter(e => e.aggregateId === id);
}

// bankAccount.js
export function applyEvents(events) {
  let balance = 0;
  for (const event of events) {
    if (event.type === 'MoneyDeposited') balance += event.data.amount;
    if (event.type === 'MoneyWithdrawn') balance -= event.data.amount;
  }
  return balance;
}

// usage
saveEvent({ aggregateId: 'acc-1', type: 'MoneyDeposited', data: { amount: 1000 } });
saveEvent({ aggregateId: 'acc-1', type: 'MoneyWithdrawn', data: { amount: 200 } });

const accountEvents = getEventsByAggregateId('acc-1');
const currentBalance = applyEvents(accountEvents);
console.log(currentBalance); // 800
```

## 🔄 8. Eventual Consistency with CQRS

In **CQRS + Event Sourcing**, the **read model** updates asynchronously after each event.

So the system might be **eventually consistent** — meaning:

> After a short delay, the read side catches up with the latest write events.

This design improves scalability but requires designing for **eventual consistency**.

---

## ⚡ 9. Benefits

✅ **Perfect audit trail:**
Every change is recorded — ideal for finance, security, and compliance.

✅ **Debugging & Replay:**
You can “replay history” to reproduce or fix state.

✅ **Temporal queries:**
You can query past states (“What was the balance last week?”)

✅ **Event-driven by design:**
Easily integrate with other services that listen for events.

✅ **Scalable reads:**
Works beautifully with CQRS and distributed systems.

---

## ⚠️ 10. Challenges

❌ **Complexity:**
Harder to implement and maintain than simple CRUD.

❌ **Storage growth:**
Event logs can grow huge — need archiving or snapshotting.

❌ **Versioning:**
When event schema changes, older events need to be translated or versioned.

❌ **Eventual consistency:**
Read side may lag slightly behind write side.

## 🧱 11. Real-World Example (Flow Summary)

```
User → Deposit Money
→ Command: DepositMoney
→ Event: MoneyDeposited(accountId=101, amount=1000)
→ Event Store saves event
→ Event published to Event Bus
→ Read Model updates "AccountBalance = 1000"
→ User queries → Reads from fast view
```

## 🧩 13. CQRS + Event Sourcing = Powerful Combo

* **CQRS** → separates reads and writes
* **Event Sourcing** → stores every state change as an event

Together, they provide:

* Scalability
* Flexibility
* Auditability
* Event-driven integration
