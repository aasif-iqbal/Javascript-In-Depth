## The difference between function definition and function declaration in JavaScript lies in what information they provide and when the function is created.

### Function Declaration:

A function declaration tells the compiler (or interpreter in JavaScript's case) about the function's existence, including its name, parameters (if any), and return type (if any).

It doesn't allocate memory or provide the function's body (the code to be executed).

Function declarations can be placed anywhere in your code, even before the first time the function is called. This is because the function is hoisted (made available) before the code is executed.

Example:


```JavaScript

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(sum(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

In this example, the sum function is declared before it's called. The declaration tells JavaScript about the function's name, parameters (a and b), and return type (number).

### Function Definition:

A function definition provides the complete function body, which includes the code to be executed when the function is called.
It allocates memory for the function and creates the executable code.

Function definitions are typically placed at the beginning of your code or at the time they are needed to avoid hoisting-related issues.

Example:


```JavaScript

// Function definition without hoisting (would result in an error if called before definition)
const multiply = function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
```

Here, the multiply function is defined using a function expression, assigning it to a constant. The function definition includes the function's body with the calculation for multiplication. Since it's not a declaration, it cannot be called before it's defined.
Key Points:
- Function declarations can be called before they are defined, while function definitions cannot (without special techniques).
- Function declarations provide a reference to the function, while function definitions create the function itself.
- Use function declarations for global functions or functions needed throughout your code.
- Use function definitions (expressions) for functions needed only in specific parts of your code or when you want to avoid hoisting-related issues.
