1. RESTful API Development (ETA: 4-6 hours)
Objective:

Build a simple RESTful API to manage a collection of "Books". The API should allow CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books and should store data in a MongoDB
database.
Requirements:

● Implement the following endpoints:
○ POST /books: Add a new book. 
○ GET /books: Get all books.
○ GET /books/:id: Get a book by ID.
○ PUT /books/:id: Update a book by ID.
○ DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book by ID.

● Use Express.js for routing and handling HTTP requests.
● Use MongoDB as the database for storing book data (can be a local or cloud-based
instance).
● The book should have at least three fields (e.g., title, author, year).
● Implement basic validation for inputs.
● Implement error handling for common issues like invalid input, missing parameters, etc.
